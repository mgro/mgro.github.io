Concerned with the explosion of biological data for etiologic inquiry and the use of existing data to inform public health decision making, the course focuses on research synthesis and meta-analysis. We will review the principles and methods for combining epidemiology studies and introduce how other types of scientific evidence, such as toxicology or mode-of-action data, can be incorporated using weight of- evidence analyses. This course will emphasize the use of critical reviews and meta-analysis to explore data and identify sources of variation among studies. Course Activities: Students will learn the principles of a systematic review, to use existing meta-analys is software to apply principles outlined in the course on example data sets, and, on a topic of their choice, to conduct a critical review or meta-analysis that appropriately weights effect estimates in each study, assesses uncertainty, and incorporates other kinds of scientific data in the overall analysis
