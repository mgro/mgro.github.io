About me
-----

I graduated with an MD-PhD from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. I became interested in tuberculosis during my undergraduate studies that featured internships in lung clinics in Belarus and Romania. Shocked by the burden this ancient disease is causing still today, and inspired by the health professionals working in such high-incidence settings, I went on to study tuberculosis in the laboratories of Roland Brosch at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and Prof Stefan Niemann at the Research Center Borstel, Germany. My PhD thesis comprised experimental work on recombinant BCG strains and genomic analyses of mycobacteria and the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
