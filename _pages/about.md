About me
======

I graduated with an MD-PhD from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. I became interested in tuberculosis during my undergraduate studies that featured internships in lung clinics in Belarus and Romania. Shocked by the burden this ancient disease is causing still today, and inspired by the health professionals working in such high-incidence settings, I went on to study tuberculosis in the laboratories of Roland Brosch at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and Prof Stefan Niemann at the Research Center Borstel, Germany. My PhD thesis comprised experimental work on recombinant BCG strains and genomic analyses of mycobacteria and the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.


Research Interests

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
